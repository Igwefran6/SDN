            <li>
              <strong>Lack of Awareness:</strong> Many businesses and
              individuals remain unaware of their rights and responsibilities
              under the NDPR, leading to widespread non-compliance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Limited Enforcement Capacity:</strong> Regulatory bodies
