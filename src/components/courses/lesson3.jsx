          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Enacted in January 2019, the NDPR serves as a comprehensive
            framework for data protection in Nigeria. It seeks to regulate how
            personal data is collected, processed, stored, and shared by
            organizations. Key provisions of the NDPR include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Consent Requirement:</strong> Organizations must obtain
              explicit consent from individuals before collecting or processing
              their personal data. This ensures that data subjects are aware of
              how their information will be used.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Subject Rights:</strong> The NDPR grants individuals
              rights over their data, including the right to access, correct,
              and delete their personal information. These rights empower
              individuals and promote transparency.
            </li>
            <li>

              and processors are required to implement adequate security
              measures to protect personal data. They must also appoint Data
              Protection Officers (DPOs) to oversee compliance with the NDPR.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Penalties for Non-Compliance:</strong> Organizations that
              violate the NDPR may face hefty fines and legal repercussions,
              which serve as a deterrent against negligence in data handling
              practices.
            </li>

            While the NDPR is a significant milestone for data protection in
            Nigeria, several challenges hinder its effective implementation:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Lack of Awareness:</strong> Many organizations and
              individuals remain unaware of their rights and obligations under
              the NDPR, leading to widespread non-compliance and exploitation of
              personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Limited Enforcement Resources:</strong> Regulatory bodies
              often lack the necessary manpower and funding to effectively
              enforce the NDPR, resulting in limited accountability for
              violators.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Varied Compliance Levels:</strong> Organizations vary in
              their readiness to comply with the NDPR, leading to
              inconsistencies in data protection practices across sectors.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The NDPR represents a crucial advancement in Nigeria's data
            protection landscape. However, ongoing efforts are required to
